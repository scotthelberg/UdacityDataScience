Libraries Used:

I am completing this project as part of my requirement in the Data Scientist Nanodegree course at Udacity

Files used:
   - Public.csv - 2017 Stack Overflow survey respondent data
   - Udacity Blog Post Jupyter Notebook file 

I tested three items. First, what is the most desirable skill of software developers? It was determined that communication skills and the ability of getting things done had the highest ratings. Experience items, like titles and reputation had the lowest ratings. Second, I tested whether there was a correlation between Career Satisfaction and Salary. While there was a positive correlation, it was not severe. Lastly, the respondents had to answer how they pronounce the work "GIF". The vast majority use a hard "g" like "gift. 

Thank you to the Udacity team for providing the data and giving me exposure to the data science world. Acknowledgements also to RSM for giving me the opportunity to delve into this curiousity and diversify my skillsets.
